<h3>Chapter II</h3>
<h2>Something About the Night shift</h2>
<p>　Just a day at sea, and the hand with the scout job quit saying he saw a large spirit lurking in the ship. Not one for bad sleep, I suppose. And missing out on a nice bump of cash for each night, that's why I damn near jumped the Captain for the job. I'll be working midnight till six, so I oughtta hit the berth right 'bout now.</p>
<p>　I never knew the wires on the lights dotting every wall could be pulled out, and they even retract on their own. Happy chance, though they are cumbersome to tug at while writing this. Indoors, seeing them clank clank on every surface as they reel back is just about my only entertainment. And when unobstructed they make a nice sturdy whirr.</p>
<p>　After I jotted down my entry, I went on with my duties. Keeping watch of the extensive ocean, and the main deck. The latter of which I didn't really gotta pay so much attention to considering the few sleeping folk there. These old cozy couches are some's preferred sleeping spots, you know.</p>
<p>　Mere minutes into the shift, I, with boredom, stared blankly into a wall. And the jukebox on it reminded me; I've coins in my pocket! Suddenly the idea of this scouting thing became a whole lot less fatiguing, as some years ago a few jukeboxes were salvaged and installed on this ship. The staleness of my time turned into loud lone singing inside and smoking outside. I'm liking this little gig... Jig, even.</p>
<p>　Soon enough, the night pulled away, and I was in the presence of the chief engineer and the steward, freakish early birds they are, even tried to pull me into the chit chat. Anyway, it was time to go bug awake the newbie, Fabian, just as he bugged me to get his very own dead end job. I wasn't going to wake him up for nothing though, as I was allowed into the galley and made us a veggie soup. Turns out he's no big fan of such thing, as he hooked the fish chunks on his claws and ate that lone.</p>
<p>　At the work all we ever do is shovel coal into the mechanical stoker. And the occasional oil run. Since there are two of us it's half the pay and half the work, for Cap is one righteous old prick, he's got all the bite in the world if you try to have him give just the littlest bit of slack, does more math on the pay than the ship's route, and I swear by that.</p>
<p>　Newbie tried to begin a chat. &quot;You slept really early yesterday, no?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Yeah I did, was scouting.&quot; I mentioned dismissively.</p>
<p>　&quot;Scouting for what?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Scouting for pirates. Now shut up, will you? I'm tryin' ta space out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>　He broke eye contact and thrust his spade into the coal, &quot;I was only asking, ma'am.&quot;</p>
<p>　I shushed him, and finally we were working to only the sound of the fire.</p>
<p>　I screwed with his confidence for casual conversation in the workplace that day, kept to himself as did I. And even out of work hours he was hesitant to ask if I had finished with my cane of sugar. I wasn't, but gave him it anyway, only out of pity.</p>
<p>　Night came, and it was time for me to prepare for the next shift of scouting. Which I was looking forward to, with a pocket of exactly seven coins digging into my side I slept, unwise on my end, but I'm not so thin it bothers me, unlike those mainlanders.</p>
<p>　I woke in darkness, to the ever present sound of the ship's coke born steel, and the snores of the newbie on top. As silent as I could, I hopped to the ground, and without turning on the light I searched for my clothes. Rustling in the pile I found something with an acceptable smell, and my pocket bag of hazel. Turning to the looming hanger, I considered a jacket, but another thought was anxiously pecking my mind: Was it always this tall? In the end I disregarded the trick the dark was playing on me, and walked out the berth already, up the winding stairs. A late tinge of regret followed as I decided not to bring my leg's aid, but I persisted for the sake of natural healing, or therapy, or whatever name the body's nature is getting called nowadays.</p>
<p>　A moonless night it was. It had a pleasant breeze to soothe the soul. I should mention for scouting I was given a little tool to aid in my far range vision; A little set of glasses void of any lenses, rather it just covered the back and a bit of the flank of my eyes to have —in the Captain's words— &quot;Your head worry about less things than it should, 'n' you see things all the more sharp.&quot;</p>
<p>　Makes enough sense, I close an eye and squint the other when shooting a gun, and that plenty improves the shot.</p>
<p>　I peered seawards to the beauty of the two abysses before me. In one abyss my eyes perceived a sheer drop, the kind that gets your stomach all funny just looking down it. The horizon bore the immense weight of the second abyss, but this one is a lot less lonely of a sight, full of stars; Pinnacles of fates long concluded with greatness. I'd make a pretty star, I reckon, I just got to end it with something spectacular, sooner or later. Sooner or later.</p>
<p>While leaning callously on the long wrought guard rail, my brooding line of thought was broken by the sound of clumsy wings flapping right past my rear, then away. My hair stood straight and along it me —not really, I could only stand crooked—, whipping out my pipe ahead of myself as the one weapon adjacent item on my person. Some huge seabird it had to be to spook me so bad.</p>
<p>I kept on my scouting route, going below deck and following the hallways left and right, tugging with me a lantern in my paws whenever one was near. Too much of the time I was hurriedly shuffling in the dark lengths of the ship's veins for the safety of the light. Till one of those awkward moments I had to walk a full length, unlit in the middle. I paused as I felt a presence, and focused the little sight I had to spot the edge of a floating crescent in the dark; The curve of what looked like a huge horn, or a fang? I know it wasn't a beak cause whatever it was, its owner made a huge, slow, rolling exhale that a bird don't make. And that's what turned me petrified. I was lost for words and motions till after it walked off with subtle steps. My leg failed me as I scrambled on three to the nearest light, and grabbed it so tight its rubber handle creaked, that sound nearly all covered by my hearts' beat.</p>
<p>　I've called it off early and now sit at the edge of the Newbie's bunk with the door shut tight, writing this entry with a pencil broken thrice.</p>
<p>　I sat staring at the porthole with my head feeling tense and my eyelids heavy as anchors. Eyes peered back at me, glowing. Retracting 'fore the horn thrust through the porthole's discolored glass and I thrust back awake. I sat straight and bumped my head on the bottom of what's usually my bunk, looked round and it seemed I had passed out sometime in the night.</p>
<p>　I'm left to wonder what that thing was. Is it true the word that a wraith has began haunting us? Or are souls perished in maritime showing themselves to they who will join them soon? Horrible omens either are.</p>
<p>　Those grim thoughts I will put to wait, I need to know more the upcoming night.</p>
<p>　The aroma of vegetable broth was wafting besides the bunk, I looked down to see Fabian had gone ahead and reheated for me a portion of the old breakfast. It wasn't too cold, nor too hot, it made me feel as if the world's alright, as if I'm not full of nerves from yesternight, and not sure who or what to blame on its scare.</p>
<p>　I wasn't going to say a peep of what happened, else I'll bring misfortune and even dread. Fabian understood not to speak in work hours, and only opened his yapper in the washroom. He asked &quot;How was the night, Haidy?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Fine. Just tiring, is all.&quot; I said, preoccupied with washing my hair, its curls loosening with the thorough rubs.</p>
<p>　Fabian mused about my hair, &quot;So it isn't always like that.&quot; or something of the sort.</p>
<p>　After some pause I took the initiative &quot;Quittin' in not too long, at least. 'Fore summer sun reaches a pinnacle, and the fresh breeze thas funneled here comes a blaze.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;What then?&quot; He pleaded.</p>
<p>　&quot;What then is I take my hoard and go ta the city ta spend it. Then back ta the country ta my little old house and start a crop. Till fall comes and I start lookin' for a contract or a tourney to get another hoard o' cash for the next winter.</p>
<p>&quot;But they don't let a lady get a tourney with a leg like this no more. They think it'd be cheatin', and they're right to say that, yeah. Only no matter how much I say it can't be cheatin' with a brace my kind-they just don't let me in, like my leg is a piston or somethin'. Sure damn wish it was so I can kick <em>their</em> shins in, see how it feels.&quot; What was said was entirely too much. Fabian looked to my leg with curiosity, head cranked low cause of just how tall he be.</p>
<p>　Funny I say that actually, Fabian and I are the tallest round, I reckon. A Rae and an islander.</p>
<p>　We had our showers, I put some stuff on my hair to make it curlied up again, and all felt fine and dandy. As long as I ignored the haunting fuzzy image in my mind of that wraith, lest my imagination starts to fester on what form may have been behind that dark shape.</p>
<p>　Gun in my holster and saber in sheath, I marched into the night prepared to confront the damned wraith. But nothing came and I got bored. I pulled out my pipe to burn time just as I always do, and the damned thing knew. It knew and swiftly flew somewhere besides the ship under the horizon where nothing is seen. I dumped the haze I so carefully measured on the ground and stole to its direction, on top the superstructure, half the ship's length away.</p>
<p>With quick steps I headed for the catwalk. My hearts were beating, and beating, overtaking my hearing... Relief came over me when it postponed our meeting by flying off. Though it was not a warm, final relief, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>　Back on track, I turned off the jukeboxes I came across, trying to keep cool and ready. Yet there came one time where I drew and cocked my hammer just for me to be threatening a midnight snacker with death. There came another where it was no one at all, or maybe it was someone, the dark only obscures, it doesn't reveal. I ran light to light, glad no one was seeing the most intimidating member of the crew run ragged by shadows. It didn't catch me that night, neither did I, I guess I can call it a draw.</p>
<p>　I couldn't find my way back to my room, and found ahead that same dark corridor, an ill-fated meet. I turned away and sat on the ground under a light, as far as I could navigate from there, and only slept after eating some of the haze to subdue my thoughts to a fog.</p>
<p>　I woke up late and as disoriented as a fish out of water, I eventually found the galley and took some things of jerky, cause only dry food's allowed down near the coal. You don't even get to drink your water unless you're out the door and that be closed. Again the Captain, the pinnacle of a stickler, 'least when it comes to work. Day went as the day goes, Fabian had nothing to say, but I did owe and give a thanks, and hoped he connects the dots himself as where that slots in.</p>
<p>　I will take no coins nor haze with me tonight, I need to rid of that uneasy presence —if it was even more than a bird— 'fore the real reason a scout is needed comes along; Cause we're soon to or have already crossed pirate infested waters; Hermits who've found their calling to be stealing food, money, and cargo from trade ships in small boats stacked with guns. Will they come? Maybe 'n' maybe not, cause we keia give them the most fight back, but we need to stay careful so we can give them doom at once. Also I want to try the hwacha for real.</p>
<p>　So it starts, the shift, and I cheerlessly shuffle out of bunk to brave the night without a pipe. Well, I did take my pipe in the end but I only put in it half my usual. Still it was torture to patrol that over a cable length along the bulwark to and fro and to and so... I filled the air with figments of song while tapping my ironclad soles to it, and that seemed to sooth. Every so often I would pause at the sight of a warp in the dark, without fail it was nothing, but I tensed or hopped backwards or drew a weapon as if it was, without fail.</p>
<p>The ship does not have a figurehead, the mighty eel painted round her is her signature. Even so, this night she did. Behind the railing the shape of lowered wings, and giant ears on top, as black as the night it was motionlessly surveying. It flinched and flattened its ears which rose back where they belonged.</p>
<p>I thawed myself and reached for my gun, closed an eye, and at the click of the hammer locking in, at that it addressed me, sending a flinch at each of its few words. &quot;Shussh, <em>pest</em>.&quot; Its voice was sore and crackly, as if it hasn't talked in centuries. It didn't divert its eyes nor ears from the black water.</p>
<p>I kept priming my weapon, and while lining up the stillborn shot it grabbed the railing with its hooks and lunged off deck. I went where it stood and looked down, not that there is half a chance I would see the wraith, I didn't.</p>
<p>Looking up however, I saw a little light illuminating a small bugeye approaching us with plans that have become damned as soon as I laid my eyes on them. I was almost happy I broke line of sight with that flying menace, and ran for a port 'n' descended deep down where the so-called &quot;Fight&quot; switch was tucked away. After its hefty lever was clanked down, the propeller stopped, the horns sounded, and all electrical energy was directed to huge suns like giant limelights exposing that shitty little bugeye.</p>
<p>All 9 seamen boiled over onto the deck, I yelled &quot;Hostile on our port side!&quot; At any new face I saw with freakish excitement. As the protocol states: Small unidentified crafts unwilling to communicate are to be struck with the hwacha until underwater.</p>
<p>I ran for that beautiful machine, not that there be many crew competent at a hwacha, <em>they</em> dumped all their hwachas into our arsenal long ago. What do they know about proper handling of weapons? We wheeled the great turret to achieve line of sight, and locked the wheels to place. With a sneer I sat and vigorously turned the cranks to the target. Then, recalling the training film, did the diagnoses I needed, and counted cranks as I put the bugeye in the danger-zone. It is a hwacha after all, the target doesn't gotta be in a point, rather a huge damned oval.</p>
<p>One last look at the target: Confused little rodents, pulled out the doors by the light. Looking ahead into a multitude of suns, then barely above it at one, two, three... Six barrels which lead to an old field gun painted and textured like the stump of a tree, like the tree of life they so duly believe in. Only this one has come to reap their souls. I heard them emptying a few confused bullets hitting no one 'fore my turret overwhelmed all sound, as it began horizontally raining burning lead, punching holes in their craft and them with it.</p>
<p>I didn't let till protocol was met, and that was the end of that. Bugeye squashed, that is what happens when you try to pirate with such rickety old methods.</p>
<p>For long, excitement hung round the air, and I was promised a little bonus —but the bonus was operating the hwacha, really. But I would be a dumbass to deny money from the Captain, of course I took it— for my effort. While I have that wraith to thank, it only sped up my inevitable.</p>
<p>Inevitable. It is inevitable, the end. That wraith can't be an empty omen.</p>
<p>I'm just glad I got to have a ride on that pretty gal. Wonderful bit of engineering she is. Was that my something spectacular? Maybe.</p>
