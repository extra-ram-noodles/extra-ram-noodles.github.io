<h3>Chapter I</h3>
<h2>A plan out–A Metal brace–A bitter, wannabe friend</h2>
<p>　Filing the tenacious dirt off my claws, I silently vowed I wouldn't stay another month picking at a fake garden, for unbodied money, in the facade of a fair city. The fair city a part of a kingdom, no more a kingdom than it is a cold bureaucracy full of strange buildings, full of weeping monoliths.</p>
<p>　The hermits who inhabit this island act not warmly to outsiders, yet there I was in the workforce. The few times I asked myself it always went back to the want for more cogs in the machine. The legal method of exit is a heavy toll, one the tiny individual of theirs can barely save up before their short life expires. I wasn't going to save up a penny, however, I was getting out sooner or later by means dubious.</p>
<p>　That garden I work to upkeep is a part of a hotel placed strategically at the port, yet even so, guests are rare. Especially if you'd like to meet others who aren't averse to the idea of a part-timer on their ship.</p>
<p>　One logy morning, a column of smoke approached from under the horizon unbeknownst to me as I began my day. I bathed, brushed myself, filed my teeth sharp, and that's when I spotted the black trail, betokening of the arrival of a ship of Koa origin, manned by all Keia no doubt. Sprang did I towards the balcony's out, flat up to its shut glass door for some time, till I made sure I saw what I saw. My routine went on with newfound optimism in my motions.</p>
<p>　After enduring a kibble breakfast without milk, I went out to get a closer view. Walking down the concrete steps and slopes, straying off to the grass to make myself comfortable at the edge of the patch where the dock's unsightly red concrete ground began. That vessel was a good hour or two away, I thought it wouldn't hurt if I took a nap, however long it was going to be I misjudged.</p>
<p>　I was deep asleep when a cold sharp kick into my thigh rudely woke me to an immediate sit up, for me to see a scruffy brown paw emerged from camo bermuda pants. Which themselves reveal a metal rod in tandem with the leg belonging to a keia, their shirt brought decent by two shiny little pegs of wood. Their fur was splotched with coal, and they stared at me with their strikingly dialated bright brown eye. They spoke in their native tongue with some attempt to iron out their accent, barking out deliberately &quot;So you are alive, Bellboy?&quot; and extending a glove-less paw to hoist me up.</p>
<p>　&quot;You think you can guide me to the⸺Grand Wings hotel?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Oh uhm, yes, of course! We've been expecting such a visit!&quot; I stammered out at the mention of the hotel I work for.</p>
<p>　&quot;Oh, you don't speak broken, thank crossings.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;I suppose I don't.&quot; Said I before guiding them to the quadrant arranged to be their crew's; For the reservations of the hotel are made and payed beforehand through radio communication, I've not half an idea how exactly it works, not that it was within my duties to care.</p>
<p>　Come the night, it's put down that my shift was to be at the keia crew's wing, with me was going to be the only other non-hermit coworker; A keek with an intimidating wing span and by extention height, though her demeanor is anything but grim, she's bright and chatty, but perhaps some amount overbearing, superimposing the title 'friend' onto me ever since we met. Her name is in such fluctuating pitch and strange tongue I shan't disrespect it with an attempt of transliteration, she's content in being nicknamed after her favorite snack, anyway, Clementine.</p>
<p>　At that late hour we were finally with the time to go to the local plaza, a little old place lined with vending machines all around. Should one crave a cheap meal or the rare unprocessed snack; This is the place. Meat pie was my pick, while she had more coffee and some junk muffins. I begrudgingly shared with her a bowl of kibble to round off the meal, I found it with an intact seal on the floor, out of one of the machines that had been dented badly by something recent, I thought.</p>
<p>　Then the day was over. Clem and I made it our post, to the dreary little breakroom we were to sleep in. It was furnished with but a couch and a cheap screen of the round, colourless sort.</p>
<p>　I approached the crowded pool where the two dozen or such keia congregated. Many ears bobbed about in the water which reeked of chlore, and was discoloured with coal. Some chairs layed before it, while some more seating was under the concrete lip of the building for they who seek the cool embrace of fans and the dark. A dim streak in that shade drew me to one of the figures sitting there, it was a streak of smoke tracing back to a comparatively tall figure, their face obscured by a sinful magazine by the name of 'Playbunny'. Soon I identified their metal supported leg belonging to the same keia who kicked me awake. I stepped to them with hopes of getting myself some spot in the ship.</p>
<p>　&quot;Hello! I believe we've met before.&quot; I began, standing at their side with a bribe of ice cold water.</p>
<p>　They peered from the magazine &quot;Yes we have, for sure.&quot; Then puffed in smoke as they looked at me, like a dragon talking down to a knight. &quot;You don't forget someone so outta place.&quot; They snapped the magazine shut before grabbing the drink.</p>
<p>　I rode on the remark —more timidly than what I would've liked— echoing &quot;Out of place, yeah.&quot; They let the anticipation linger, forcing me to finish the thought &quot;...That's why I'd like to maybe tag along. I'll be gone as soon as your ship touches land other than this wicked place.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Go away.&quot;</p>
<p>　I went on &quot;Though I don't seek to stowaway all useless, no!&quot; And stood erect.</p>
<p>　&quot;Can't doubt your size, but that means everything's too small, no?&quot; They showed emotion in their tone for just about the first time.</p>
<p>　&quot;I'll make it work!&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;By the Pinnacle, you're staunch.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;is that a yes?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Guess I'll ask Ol' Cap. Be there 'morrow at sundown, hear?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Hear!&quot;</p>
<p>　I thought about exchanging names, yet neither I nor they chose to that moment. I also wanted to stay a while but alas, my patience for noise was eroded, and lunchtime was approaching, anyhow.</p>
<p>　Clem would follow me to that same manually operated sandwich shop every day, so that's where I headed. Through the streets the plinking of my claws against the tiled paths was embarrassingly audible, its pristine cleanliness is reminiscent of a labyrinth, I thought. An orange glow peeked at me from the final corner, and soon I was chiming into the shop. I sat with no exchange of words, in wait of Clementine as to deliver the news.</p>
<p>　The owner was a sweet old blind hermit, warm and devoid of prejudice, well read as well. He knew me by the sound of my steps and bid me good noon, although it was still the late morning.</p>
<p>　I wondered how a flying species such as her could be so inaccurate with time, and waited for the lesser half of an hour before catching her large figure swooping by the window. She entered the shop with wet eyes as her translucent second pair of eyelids retreated. It's always been puzzling how they aim their tools of war with such limited vision, goggles perhaps? Anywho, she greeted me with a nod and smile, and I got up to order. Order one 'chick-in-sandwich', make it two, and hold the tomatoes.</p>
<p>　About half way into the meal, I broke my typical wordless munching, with my mouth some amount full &quot;Have you maybe seen the copper shipment that docked recently? big ship-&quot; Cutting off with a patient swallow of drink.</p>
<p>　&quot;What about that smoggy hunk full of pests?&quot; Was her tangy rejoinder.</p>
<p>　&quot;About them,&quot; I resumed &quot;I've found they may just have an empty spot or two on board.&quot;</p>
<p>　Her ears perked up high. &quot;I'll be going with them in a day's time, wanna follow?</p>
<p>　She snickered &quot;Pfshh⸺Sure you are!&quot;</p>
<p>　Time seemed to stretch waiting for her jester's smile to fade. &quot;You are?&quot; Her voice rose high as her ears.</p>
<p>　&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;But why, all the sudden?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;That's the end flag, ever since I got more or less stranded here.&quot;</p>
<p>　She quirked her head a peculiar way &quot;You never told me you wanted to leave!&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;We've known each other for two weeks, Clementine.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;But...&quot; She trailed &quot;But we always chatted through it all.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;I couldn't begin to dare call them back and forth chats.&quot; I grumbled.</p>
<p>　She scowled with her nose and coarsened her voice &quot;Why you cold all the sudden? Just cause you gone get to leave dudn't mean you can get on some kinda high horse and leave your one friend. Without me you would have gone insane, and without you? <em>I</em> just might go insane. You know this place, and you know how just miserable it gets.&quot; She drew a long breath, and took a longer gulp of water, a keek speaking any language other than their own sounds scratchy, and is scratchy for their throats.</p>
<p>　In that silence I brought forth a rebuttal &quot;We've been pals at best, I guess. But not to the point I pass a chance like that, no.&quot;</p>
<p>　Clementine stood up and her voice rose to a raspy shout &quot;Well, see you later, then! Have fun with the pests!&quot; She stormed out of the store. I never saw her again.</p>
<p>　I asked around the dock with the little I knew about that mysterious keia, and after not too long one answered &quot;Oh you mean the islander? She's out in the beach, so I heard. That was some bit ago though, so I dunno if she's back here somewhere or-&quot; Bang! A small gun echoed in the distance, along with a waning metal ring. From its direction stood two figures barely visible in the dying sunlight.</p>
<p>　I put on my gloves and went to investigate, many more shots were thrust into the soundscape as I trotted towards them, to see she who I was looking for, and a crude construct of wood holding up a heavily dented pan. I asked her a simple &quot;What doing?&quot; Broken in jest. She stared before loosening her hearing protection; A cotton filled black sleeve on each long ear tightened into the shape of a cinnamon-roll, less comfortable than keek ear protection from what I know, but it clearly does the job well. &quot;What was that, fangs?&quot; She asked.</p>
<p>　I repeated myself subtracting the jokey mistake this time and she responded &quot;Sharpening an old skill, as one does.&quot;</p>
<p>　Peculiar was the placement of the target, it was close to where we stood, I pointed that out and she gave me an odd look. The truth with keias, I learned, is their naked eye doesn't have such a good shot, and their remedy for it is a costly, nausea inducing eyepiece. Of course the aforementioned she did not have then, &quot;Can't hit otherwise, genius.&quot; She said. And I fell silent in thought.</p>
<p>　&quot;Wanna... Give it a shot?&quot; She awkwardly offered as she loaded the last few shots from her pocket. I was hesitant, but mustered up a yes in the middle of her replacing the grip to something befitting of my paws.</p>
<p>　&quot;But don't expect anything spectacular.&quot; I made clear.</p>
<p>　&quot;I really don't, Fangs.&quot; She shrugged, simply happy to share what she enjoys.</p>
<p>　Correcting her I said &quot;You can call me Fabian. And you?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Haidy, if you oughtta know.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;Now, Haidy, how am I to use this?&quot; I held the gun improperly, say for how I made sure it wasn't pointed at either of us. She fixed it in my paw and pulled the hammer back, and instructed to &quot;Hold all but the trigger tight, aim down the sight, and bang, got it?&quot; I nodded, and she asked me to count to five as she blocked my ears with her firm, rough digits. And I shot and missed, she told me to prime the hammer myself, and I shot again, and missed, you may guess what happened to the last shot.</p>
<p>　You guess wrong! It hit, and I'm proud.</p>
<p>　She suggested we be on the dock before today's light leaves. And so I put on my gloves. Haidy in a nagging tone called me sensitive when she saw me do so. Then &quot;Race you there?&quot; She suggested out of nowhere.</p>
<p>　&quot;A little childish to ask of a stranger, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;There is no nuance in my question. Race you there?&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;I suppose so?&quot;</p>
<p>　She secured her gun, and held up three of her four digits. &quot;On count of THREE-TWO-ONE-&quot; Was the scramble of words that ran out her mouth before she then I dashed, looking like a chase of predator and prey. Haidy hopped and slipped on the sand, while I cantered then galloped at an unwavering pace. She screamed exasperated as she lost her lead, and I made a point to stick out my tongue. Near the finish line I missed a step, and went rolling on the sand, ending up on my back. She halted as well with much more grace, and threw herself besides me, whispering &quot;That oughtta teach ya manners~&quot; Before she huffed.</p>
<p>　I puffed no less than her, it's been long since the last time I ran full steam ahead &quot;I'm fine, thanks for asking.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;I won by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>　&quot;No you didn't.&quot; I stated the obvious.</p>
<p>　As we descended down the ship, the sea breeze died, replaced by a haunting stillness. After many a step, the air became warm, but when we reached the bottom, some semblance of fresh air returned, I must say I sighed in relief. We were then at the corridors we'll spend a good few days in. In them three keia may walk abreast, that's not accounting for the many pipes and protrusions I kept bumping into, like the biggest bumblebee there ever been. What I and Haidy are to do is shovel coal into the mechanical stoker, that is to say our jobs needed brawn and no brain, I have no concept if it pays well, but I do know I had to sign a paper to say that I am entitled to the pay.</p>
<p>　The shift began. Haidy had already fit her paws in her work boots, and took her shirt off, that latter act I mimicked. I picked the biggest size shovel and went on with the far from journal-worthy work. Shovel shovel shovel. Drink water. Shovel some more. That was the work and the only work from sundown to midnight.</p>
<p>　It did not drain my body —our breaks were spaced alright—, but the late hour did drain my mental. Haidy upon the sight of my grim eyes offered a draw of her pipe, but I wasn't nearly miserable enough to try that. I was just yearning for bed, even if suspended by little chains with shabby looking hooks. I took the bottom bunk and was out as the light was.</p>
<p>　I awoke with a little care package under my bunk, it had some brushes and teeth files and such, as well as a charcoal pencil and a big empty journal for me to fill. Also a blanket that I could have appreciated earlier, and an outdated flag of home for me to hang up, and some clothes.</p>
<p>　Haidy wants us cooking and having breakfast earlier than is sane, I suppose I'll bite. My pencil's gone dull, and this is all caught up, anywho.</p>
